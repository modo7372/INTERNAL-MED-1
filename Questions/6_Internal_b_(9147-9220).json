      "explanation": "Echocardiography (Option B) is the most widely used and important clinical tool for assessing ejection fraction (EF) due to its availability, non-invasive nature, and ability to provide real-time assessment of wall motion and valvular function. While MRI Heart (Option C) is the gold standard for volume quantification, Echo is the primary first-line investigation. ECG (Option A) assesses electrical activity, not pumping function. Coronary angiography (Option D) visualizes vessels, not contractile function directly.",
